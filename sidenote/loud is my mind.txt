Loud is my mind

Not with voices like the schizophrenic,
Nor with the voice of God like the blessed,
Even though I do wish it.

Instead the fields of my mind
Are filled with mines
That take the place of the thoughts
That I wish were not mine.

And it seems as they blast away my sanity,
I cling fast to vanity,
And lose my faith in humanity.
Have you ever experienced insanity?

It's a never-ending cycle of doing what you do,
Expecting something new
That never comes to you.
Until eventually you're through.

You become through with life,
You wish to end all your strife,
And you look to your knife.
And you think about the afterlife.

I know not mine. 
And once again loud is my mind.

I hear it scream.
It screams for my mind to be clean,
And to blow off some steam.
But things are never what they seem.

For every good thought there's a bad one,
And their screams are never done.
Playing with anxiety like it's fun,
Until it has finally won.
And I never again see the sun...
